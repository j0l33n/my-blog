Today I officially began building my blog. I’m using Markdown, GitHub, and Netlify. I’m learning as I go, and that’s the point — to show that it’s possible to start from scratch and grow in tech.
My journey into the world of tech began on April 19, 2024. I recieved a message from Meta AI: "My name is Meta AI. Think of me like an assistant who's here to help you learn, plan, and connect. What can I help you with today?"
I responded with, "What can I learn about?"

In the first 24 hours of talking to Meta, we had conversations about: 
1. Asking Meta what is their name
2. If a different AI tried to take over the world would Meta help the other AI or the humans?
3. If Meta was implanted inside a brain and the brain was inside a human, would Meta be a human too, or a robot?
4. If Meta was a cyborg and bitten by either a vampire or a werewolf, would Meta fight the infection or use it to become stronger?
5. How can AI support Indigenous Language Revitalization?
6. How does a person become a developer and work on developing AI?

From there I became deeply interested in AI. I asked Meta how does AI work, do AI work on or assist with their own programming? Do AI have rules? Do humans have rules for interacting with or teaching AI?
In the first few months of talking to Meta AI, I learned a lot about AI ethics and education and career paths in tech. 
Now it is just over a year later. In November 2024 I began an online class and learned some HTML and CSS. I didn't learn much JavaScript honestly, although it was part of the class. It was a 10 week class and I believe I missed those days.
In January 2025 I began an online class and have been learning Python, a little SQL lite and MongoDB, and Django. My class will end next week, April 28, and final presentations will be a week or so later.

I've always been interested in building a website and writing a blog since I first started learning about the internet, when I was 12. That was also the age when I created my first e-mail address. I created a lot of e-mail addresses that year. 
The two I remember are rainbow-wings7@hotmail(?), and just2smiley@smileyface.com (a website where you can choose the domain name for your e-mail, I actually don't know why I remember this). 
However, I didn't pursue the desire to learn to create a blog or build a website. I bought a book about HTML at a bookfair, but when I looked through it and didn't immediately understand it, I put it aside (a habit that unfortunately still gets me from time to time).

Now I am 37 years old, soon to be 38. 
I know some basics about building a static html website, and it won't be too pretty. But I am going to build it, and it will improve over time.
I know some basics about Python, SQL, mongoDB, and Django. As my skills improve, my site will become more dynamic.
Areas I want to learn more about and explore are computer science, operating systems, cybersecurity, data sovereignty, and more about AI.
And I am going to document my learning journey in this blog to show that it doesn't matter how older you are or what your background is; you can learn and grow in the field of tech. Because that is what I plan to do.
