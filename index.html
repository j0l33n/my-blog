        I am a smelqmix woman approaching 40 who is learning tech from the ground up. <br>
        I created this site to document my journey and share my experiences, <br>
        and hopefully inspire others who might feel like they started too late.<br>
        Here, you'll find my blog posts, you can learn about who I am, and I will post links to projects as I build them.<br><br>

        I published this site in April of 2025. <br>
        Six months ago, back in November of 2024, I had the desire to learn about tech, but no knowledge or understanding.<br>
        Now I have a website.
