        I am a smelqmix woman approaching 40 who is learning tech from the ground up. <br>
        Back in November of 2024, I had the desire to learn about tech, but no knowledge or understanding.<br>
        In April of 2025 I created this site to document my journey, share my experiences, <br>
        and hopefully inspire others who might feel like they started too late.<br>
        Here you will find my blog posts, you can learn about who I am, and I will post links to projects as I build them.<br><br>      

        So far I have learned HTML, CSS, Python, and Django. <br>
        I've been introduced to JavaScript, MongoDB, and SQL, but I still have a lot to learn. <br>
        This website will be constantly changing and evolving as I learn more.
