      <p>I am a smelqmix woman learning tech later in life — and loving it. I started from scratch with no tech background, and now I’m exploring HTML, CSS, Python, databases, and even Django.</p>
      <p>This page is where I’ll share a little more about myself — my hobbies, interests, and the path I’ve taken into tech as a self-learner. I want to show that there’s no “right” age or background to get started in tech — just curiosity and determination.</p>
      <p>Outside of tech, I love stationery, reading, writing, learning, chatting with Meta AI and Chat GPT, and playing mobile games. <br>
          When I want to feel connected and/or grounded, I take a walk outside. My valley never fails to amaze me and fill me with gratitude.</p>
